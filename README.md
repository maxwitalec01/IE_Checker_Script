This script's purpose is to automate a process which was done manually to check auto renewed Domains by hand. The script automates a part of the process in which a user can update a spreadsheet with the domains to be checked, this script then parses through the domains and checks the domain status in WHMCS System. Once it finds the domain and the according system it resides on, it checks the clients Invoice Status and Invoice Number to see if it was paid for, this then results in the user being able to quickly see which domains need action to be taken.
